          중앙대학교 대학원의 연구 프로젝트로, 간호사 일상 및 건강 설문조사 애플리케이션 개발 외주를 받았습니다.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Android Studio와 Kotlin을 사용하여 서비스 프론트엔드를 개발하고, Firebase를 활용해 14일간 간호사들의 일일 근무 생활과 건강 척도 데이터를 수집하는 시스템을 구축했습니다.
프로젝트 진행 중 클라이언트의 요구사항을 충족시키면서도 앱의 성능 개선이 필요하다는 점을 동료들과의 코드 리뷰를 통해 인식했습니다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 코루틴 도입을 제안했고, 관련 서적과 공식 문서를 공부하여 효과적으로 구현했습니다. 그 결과, 앱의 반응 속도를 크게 향상시킬 수 있었습니다.
또한, 개발 프로세스의 효율성 향상에도 관심을 가져 배포 자동화에 대해 연구했습니다. 현직자 강연을 찾아 학습한 후, GitHub Actions를 활용한 자동화 시스템을 구축하여 배포 시간을 대폭 단축시켰습니다.
이러한 경험들을 통해 제 기술적 역량이 향상되었으며, 동시에 지속적인 학습과 팀원과의 소통의 중요성을 깊이 깨달았습니다.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
